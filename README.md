### 2. Advanced DBMS Features Tests

#### Location-Based Car Search
1. Navigate to Dashboard → Find Nearest Cars
2. Select a location (e.g., "Chittagong, Chittagong")
3. Set radius (e.g., 50km)
4. Verify cars are sorted by distance
5. Check distance calculations are accurate

#### Client Management
1. Go to Dashboard → Clients
2. Filter by category (Regular, Premium, Corporate, VIP)
3. Search by name or email
4. Verify pagination works correctly

#### Driver Management & Salary Updates
1. Navigate to Dashboard → Drivers
2. Select multiple drivers using checkboxes
3. Use "Bulk Salary Update" with a percentage (e.g., 10%)
4. Verify all selected drivers' salaries updated atomically
5. Check that transaction rollback works if there's an error

#### Driver Applications
1. Go to Dashboard → Applications
2. Review pending applications
3. Test approve/reject functionality
4. Verify approved drivers are created in the system

#### Analytics & Reporting
1. Navigate to Dashboard → Analytics
2. Check various charts and statistics
3. Verify data accuracy against database

### 3. Database Integrity Tests
- Create orders and verify all relationships are maintained
- Test cascade deletes and foreign key constraints
- Verify indexes are working for performance
